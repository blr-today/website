> [Penciljam](https://penciljam.com/main/) is a community for people who love
  drawing on location. It organizes events on weekends to draw. It is a project of the 
  [Nabachika Foundation](https://nabachika.com/web/) for the Citizen Arts.

It’s free to join, and you don’t have to be an artist – just bring a
sketchbook, a pencil, and a curious mind.
