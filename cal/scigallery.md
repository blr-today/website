> Science Gallery Bengaluru (SGB) is a not-for-profit public institution for
research-based engagement targeted at young adults working at the intersection
of the human, natural, and social sciences, and engineering, art, and design.

SGB's mission is to ‘bring science back into culture’. This page lists events
under the "Sci560: Science in the City" programme - an exploration of the
ideas, individuals, and institutions that make science in Bengaluru.
